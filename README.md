# VulnVortex
## Overview

VulnVortex is an open-source project provides a simple yet extensible penetration testing tool written in python. The tool is designed to simulate various aspects of a penetration test, including network scanning, vulnerability assessment, exploitation, and report generation.

## Key Features

- **Network Scanning:** Scan specified IP addresses and port ranges to identify open ports and services.
- **Vulnerability Assessment:** Perform basic vulnerability checks and log findings.
- **Exploitation Simulation:** Simulate exploitation of vulnerabilities for educational purposes (ethical use only).
- **Log Generation:** Record detailed information about each step of the penetration test.
- **Report Generation:** Create a basic penetration test report summarizing findings and providing improvement suggestions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/mawg0ud/VulnVortex`
2. Open the project in your preferred python development environment.
3. Customize the code to fit your specific penetration testing scenarios.
4. Run the application and analyze the generated log and report files.

## Usage Examples

### Scanning a Network

```csharp
ScanNetwork("192.168.1.1", 1, 100);
```

### Assessing Vulnerabilities

```csharp
AssessVulnerabilities();
```

### Simulating Exploitation

```csharp
ExploitVulnerability("192.168.1.1", 80);
```
